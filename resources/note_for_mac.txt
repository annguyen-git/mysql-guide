MySQL home directory on Mac: usr/local/mysql

Run this to start, stop and check status of MySQL on Mac:
	mysql.server start
	mysql.server stop
	mysql.server status

	Usage: mysql.server  {start|stop|restart|reload|force-reload|status}

Or if you install MySQL through home brew, you can run:
	brew services start mysql
	brew services stop mysql 
	brew service list


You may encounter an error. The reason can be one of these:

- Not set up configuration file probably. You may want to set up MYSQL_HOME then update my.cnf file so it can get correct directories of mysql programs.

	Step 1:
		echo $MYSQL_HOME or printenv MYSQL_HOME to see if you already have that variable.
		to see all variable run printenv
	Step 2:
		export MYSQL_HOME="/usr/local/mysql"	(session only)
		nano ~/.zshrc and add this line
			export MYSQL_HOME="/usr/local/mysql" (beware the spacing, zsh style requires no spacing)

		or run this 
		cat << EOF >> ~/.zshrc
		# Add MYSQL_HOME to variable
		export MYSQL_HOME="/usr/local/mysql"
		EOF
		run source ~/.zshrc
		
		or you can do the same but save it in ~/.zprofile instead


- MySQL path hasn't been added to $PATH

	Step 1:
		echo $PATH (to see paths)
		printenv PATH or env | PATH do the same thing
	Step 2:
		nano /etc/paths and add these to the file
		/usr/local/mysql/bin/
		/usr/local/mysql/support-files/ 	(you now can use any program that under this directory)
		
		if use don't want to use nano to edit it, run this 
		sudo bash -c 'echo "/usr/local/mysql/bin/" >> /etc/paths'
		sudo bash -c 'echo "/usr/local/mysql/support-files/" >> /etc/paths'

		or
		sudo bash -c 'cat << EOF >> /etc/paths
		/usr/local/mysql/bin/
		/usr/local/mysql/support-files/
		EOF'

		or 
		export PATH=${PATH}:/usr/local/mysql/bin (incase you only want session temporary change)

		Remember to restart your terminal for the change to take effect.
		printenv PATH to check if your path appears in the Path variable.
		


- Insufficient privilege for _mysql user

	Step 1:
		ls -l /usr/local/mysql (1)
		If this return a symbolic link, run
		ls -l /usr/local/mysql-version-macosversion, replace it with your actual directory returns by (1)
	Step 2:
		sudo chown -R _mysql /usr/local/mysql/ 	(change the owner of folder and all directories under it to _mysql)
		sudo chmod -R 777 /usr/local/mysql/	(change permission to rwx)
		or you can run it not on the symbolic link
		sudo chown -R _mysql /usr/local/mysql-version-macosversion
		sudo chmod -R 777 /usr/local/mysql-version-macosversion

		
- You may want to remove your redo logs
	rm /usr/local/mysql/data/ib_logfile* (replace with your actual directory)
