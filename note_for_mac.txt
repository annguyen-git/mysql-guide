MySQL home directory on Mac: usr/local/mysql
How to start and stop MySQL on Mac through terminal:

mysql.server start
mysql.server stop

You may encounter an error. The reason can be one of these:
- MySQL path hasn't been added to $PATH
	How to check?
	Step 1:
		echo $PATH (to see paths)
		printenv PATH or env | PATH do the same thing
	Step 2:
		nano /etc/paths and add these to the file
		/usr/local/mysql/bin/
		/usr/local/mysql/support-files/ 	(you now can use any program that under this directory)
		or export PATH=${PATH}:/usr/local/mysql/bin (incase you only want session temporary change)


- Insufficient privilege for _mysql user
	How to check?
	Step 1:
		ls -l /usr/local/mysql (1)
		If this return a symbolic link, run
		ls -l /usr/local/mysql-version-macosversion, replace it with your actual directory returns by (1)
	Step 2:
		sudo chown -R _mysql /usr/local/mysql/ 	(change the owner of folder and all directories under it to _mysql)
		sudo chmod -R 777 /usr/local/mysql/	(change permission to rwx)
		or you can run it not on the symbolic link
		sudo chown -R _mysql /usr/local/mysql-version-macosversion
		sudo chmod -R 777 /usr/local/mysql-version-macosversion

- You may want to set up MYSQL_HOME
	Step 1:
		echo $MYSQL_HOME or printenv MYSQL_HOME to see if you already have that variable.
		to see all variable run printenv
	Step 2:
		export MYSQL_HOME="/usr/local/mysql"	(session only)
		nano ~/.zshrc and add this line
			export MYSQL_HOME="/usr/local/mysql" (beware the spacing, zsh style require no spacing)
	Step 3: run .zshrc file
	source ~/.zshrc
		
- You may want to remove your redo logs
	rm /usr/local/mysql/data/ib_logfile* (replace with your actual directory)
